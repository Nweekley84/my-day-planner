## General Information
- Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.
- Purpose is to put into practice local storage and more importantly play around with Day.js.
- Undertaken because it utilizes what we learned in module 5, and lets us explore Day.js indepth.


## Technologies Used
- [![Chrome Dev Tools 112.0.5615.121](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chrome-112.0.5615.121-blue?logo=googlechrome)](https://developer.chrome.com/tags/new-in-devtools/) 
- [![VSCode 1.77.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-v1.77.3-blue?logo=visualstudiocode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_78)
- [![macOS Mojave 10.14.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mojave-10.14.6-blue?logo=macos)](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL2011?locale=en_US) 


## Features
- Upon page load, display the current Date in the header.
- Use plugin script for Advanced Formatting in Day.js to display 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ect..
- Wrap everything in a document.ready function so DOM loads first.
- Displays 8 time-blocks for standard work day 9am-5pm.
- Dynamically display each block with color codes to reflect past/present/future using css/js.
- Dynamically update in realtime without refreshing as hours pass.
- Store events added to each timeblock in local storage.
- Make sure stored event's persist upon refresh and display in their corresponding time-blocks.
- At 12:00am, aka Midnight/0000, reset timeblocks from past to future stylings (from grey to green).
