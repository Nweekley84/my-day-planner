## General Information
- Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.
- Purpose is to put into practice local storage and more importantly play around with Day.js.
- Undertaken because it utilizes what we learned in module 5, and lets us explore Day.js indepth.


## Technologies Used
- VSCode 1.76.2
- Chrome Dev Tools 112.0.5615.121 
- macOS Mojave 10.14.6 


## Features
- Upon page load, display the current Date in the header.
- Use plugin script for Advanced Formatting in Day.js to display 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ect..
- Wrap everything in a document.ready function so DOM loads first.
- Displays 8 time-blocks for standard work day 9am-5pm.
- Dynamically display each block with color codes to reflect past/present/future using css/js.
- Dynamically update in realtime without refreshing as hours pass.
- Store events added to each timeblock in local storage.
- Make sure stored event's persist upon refresh and display in their corresponding time-blocks.
